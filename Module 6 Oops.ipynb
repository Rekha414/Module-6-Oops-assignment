        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation also involves restricting access to some of the object's components, which is known as data hiding. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and modification of the internal state of an object.\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features to the user. It allows the user to interact with an object through a simplified interface without needing to understand the internal workings of the object. Abstraction helps in reducing complexity.\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (parent class or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes. A subclass can also override or extend the functionality of its parent class.\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows methods to have different behaviors based on the object that is calling them. This can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). It simplifies code and allows for flexibility in interacting with different types of objects.\n",
        "Composition (or sometimes called \"Aggregation\"):\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition refers to building complex objects by combining simpler objects, establishing a \"has-a\" relationship between them. Instead of relying on inheritance, composition enables an object to contain other objects as components, promoting flexibility and reusability. Unlike inheritance, composition offers greater modularity and allows for easier changes in object behavior.\n",
